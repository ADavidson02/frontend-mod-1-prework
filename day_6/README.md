    Work through [typing.io](https://typing.io/) as described in [Daily Warm Up](#daily).
    
*   #### Read part of Chapter 3 (Functions & Scope), pages 85-99, from [JavaScript & jQuery: Interactive Front-End Web Development](https://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-JQuery-Interactive-Front-End-Development/dp/1118531647/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1541447422&sr=8-5&keywords=duckett)
    
    Answer these questions about the reading in your mod 0 capstone gist:
    
    1.  If we have a function defined as `function sayHello(){console.log("Hello!")}`, what is the difference between entering `sayHello` and `sayHello()` in the console?
    2.  What is the difference between function parameters and arguments?
    3.  What is the keyword `return` used for?
    4.  How are local variables better than global variables? Are there instances you can think of where you might want to use a variable that is globally scoped over local?
    
    Do these exercises in the console.
    
    *   Work through [these problems](https://s3.amazonaws.com/TrainingNerd/JavaScriptForBeginners/exercises/functions.html) in the console about functions.
    *   Practice through some JavaScript basics exercises on [w3resource](http://www.w3resource.com/javascript-exercises/javascript-basic-exercises.php#EDITOR) and check your code against their solutions.
*   #### Work through [Command Line Crash Course](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendixa.html)
