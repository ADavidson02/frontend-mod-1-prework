pop()
  Removes the last item from the end of the array and returns the removed item. It does not specify a value, used with an empty (). It does the same thing every time, takes the last item out of the array and returns it. If the array is empty "undefined" will be the return value. This will change the length of the array.

push(element1)
  Adds zero or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array.

shift()
  Removes the first element(the zeroth indexed element) from an array and returns the removed element. This method changes the length of the array which shifts the indexes of the remaining elements down. Used with an empty (), returns undefined if the array is empty.

unshift(element1)
  Adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns the new length of the array. If multiple items are added they are added as a chunk how the were written.
