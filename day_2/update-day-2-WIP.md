# Day 2 - Arrays and Iteration

Computers may not be smart, but they are good at doing many things very quickly, like working through lots of data. As such, we need a way to store lots of data. Today, you will learn about a JavaScript data structure that lets us store collections of data: The Array. You will also learn about iteration, which is going through every element of an Array.

When you are all done with the lessons, exercises, and questions for today, you will once again use git to save your work, and then put it in the cloud on Github.
