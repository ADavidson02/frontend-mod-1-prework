// In the exercises below, write your own code where indicated
// to achieve the desired result. Run this code using node in terminal.

//TODO: change node description

var firstVar = 10;
var secondVar = 20;
var thirdVar = "10";

// example: log the result of the comparison: is firstVar greater than secondVar?
console.log(firstVar > secondVar); // this should return: false

// log the result of the comparison: is firstVar less than secondVar?
console.log(); // this should return: true

// log the result of the comparison: is firstVar equal to thirdVar? (use the == operator)
console.log(); // this should return: true

// log the result of the comparison: is firstVar strictly equal to thirdVar? (use the === operator)
console.log(); // this should return: false

// note: the strictly equal to operator compares the value of the variable in addition to the type of the variable.
// since the firstVar is an integer value and the thirdVar is a string value, although they are both equal to 10,
// the comparison still evaluates to false. The equal to operator takes only the value into account.

// log the result of the comparison: is firstVar not equal to secondVar?
console.log(); // this should return: true

// log the result of the comparison: is secondVar greater than or equal to 20?
console.log(); // this should return: true

// log the result of the comparison: is secondVar greater than or equal to 21?
console.log(); // this should return: false

// log the result of the comparison: is secondVar less than or equal to 20?
console.log(); // this should return: true

// log the result of the comparison: is secondVar less than or equal to 21?
console.log(); // this should return: true
