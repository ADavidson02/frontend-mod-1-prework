<!-- LB NOTES:
- do they do this in a repl or the console? probably a repl so they can save their work. do we want to introduce return and console.log in these initial exercises, and then switch to return when it is introduced in day 4 work?
-->

#example: Write code that prints your name 5 times:
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log("Hermione Granger");
}

# Write code below that prints the sum of 2 plus 2 7 times:
for (var i = 0; i < 7; i++) {
  # YOUR CODE HERE
}

# Write code below that prints the phrase 'She sells seashells down by the seashore'
# 10 times.
# YOUR CODE HERE
