# In the exercises below, write your own code where indicated
# to achieve the desired result. You can run this code from `repl.it`.

<!-- LB NOTES:
- do they do this in a repl or the console? probably a repl so they can save their work. do we want to introduce return and console.log in these initial exercises, and then switch to return when it is introduced in day 4 work?

# example: Write code that combines the variables below into another string:
var name = "Ron";
var team = "Chudley Cannons";

console.log("The " + team + " are " + name + "'s favorite Quidditch team");

# Write code that combines the variables below into a string that reads "The
# quick red fox jumped over the lazy brown dog":
var speedy = "quick red fox";
var slow_poke = "lazy brown dog";

console.log(# YOUR CODE HERE);

# Write code that combines the variables below into a string that reads "In a
# predictable result, the tortoise beat the hare!"
var slow_poke = "tortoise";
var speedy = "hare";

# YOUR CODE HERE
