# In the exercises below, write your own code where indicated
# to achieve the desired result. You can run this code from `repl.it`.

<!-- LB NOTES:
- do they do this in a repl or the console? probably a repl so they can save their work. do we want to introduce return and console.log in these initial exercises, and then switch to return when it is introduced in day 4 work?

# In the exercises below, write your own code where indicated
# to achieve the desired result. You can run this code from `repl.it`.

# example: Write code below to log your name in the console:
console.log("Alan Turing")

# Write code below to log `Welcome to Turing!` in the console:
p #YOUR CODE HERE

# Write code below to log `99 bottles of pop on the wall...`:
