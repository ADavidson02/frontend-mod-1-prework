# In the exercises below, write your own code where indicated
# to achieve the desired result. You can run this code from `repl.it`.

<!-- LB NOTES/Questions:
- do they do this in a repl or the console? probably a repl so they can save their work
- do we have them do the work in atom, push to GH, and then run the files from repl? have we had luck with that?
- do we want to introduce return and console.log in these initial exercises, and then switch to return when it is introduced in day 4 work
-->

# example: Write code below to assign your name to a variable and
# log that variable to the console:
var name = "Harry Potter";
console.log(name);

# Write code below to assign the string 'Dobby' to a variable and
# log that variable to the console:
var house-elf = "Dobby";
# YOUR CODE HERE

# Write code below to save the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
# log that variable to the console:
# YOUR CODE HERE

# example: Write code below to add 2 to the variable `students` and
# log the result:
var students = 22;
# YOUR CODE HERE
console.log(students);

# Write the code below to subtract 2 students from the `students` variable and
# log the result:
# YOUR CODE HERE
console.log(students);
