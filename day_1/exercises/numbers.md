# In the exercises below, write your own code where indicated
# to achieve the desired result. You can run this code from `repl.it`.

<!-- LB NOTES:
- do they do this in a repl or the console? probably a repl so they can save their work. do we want to introduce return and console.log in these initial exercises, and then switch to return when it is introduced in day 4 work?

# In the exercises below, write your own code where indicated
# to achieve the desired result. You can run this code from `repl.it`.

# example: log the result of the sum of 2 and 2 to the console:
console.log(2 + 2);

# log the result of the difference of 7 less than 83 to the  console:
console.log(#YOUR CODE HERE);

# log the result of 6 multiplied by 53 to the  console:
console.log(#YOUR CODE HERE);

# log the result of the modulo of 10 into 54:
console.log(#YOUR CODE HERE);
